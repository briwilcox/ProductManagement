## Example
Amazon Web Services are beneficial for organizations that need inexpensive scalable infrastructure. AWS is a portfolio of easy to use cloud computing, storage, devops, analytics, and security solutions. It allows developers and organizations to spin up complex server infrastructure instantly and without purchasing expensive hardware. Unlike on premise solutions expensive and soon out of date hardware is not required, your infrastructure is always up to date, and underlying hypervisors or service specific software are not required.

# Pricing Strategy
------

*Think Microeconomics*

* Customers' willingness to pay
** Cheaper to buy from you vs make their own?
* Competitors Prices
** What does the demand curve look like? Inelastic (10% price increase leads to less than 10% decrease in demand), elastic (10% price increase leads to greater than 10% decline in demand)?
** If competitors product is not a good substitute price above market to maximize profits
** If products are close substitutes price below competitors
* Cost of goods sold
** Many firms take price of labor / inputs and increase price by fixed percent. Should be done with respect to customers willingness to pay and elasticity of demand as with other methods

Costs: Fixed Costs + Marginal Costs

Costs: What are the fixed costs, variable costs, what does this look like compared to the rest of the industry?

Volumes: Incease volumes by expanding into adjacent areas, increase sales volumes / sales force, increase marketing, reduce prices to increase market share (depending on supply and demand curves)
